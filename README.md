# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for development setup.

As name suggests, this is a personal configuration, maybe you do not like what I am doing, so you should adjust or pick things you like.

## Quick Setup

Good advise is to read the script before running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MSmaili/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

To preview what will be installed without making changes:

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```

## Manual Steps After Install

1. **Install tmux plugins**

Inside tmux, press:

```text
prefix + I
```

to install/update all plugins.

---

2. **Recommended versions**

For best compatibility with the custom scripts and commands used here, it’s recommended to have at least:

- **tmux** version **3.2a**
- **bash** version **5.x**

---

3. **Custom tmux session script**

You can define your own project/session layout in:

```bash
~/.tmux-session.json
```

Use the following format:

- Each **key** is a session name.
- Each **value** is an array of window paths for that session.

Example:

```json
{
  "nvim": ["~/.config/nvim"],
  "dotfiles": ["~/dotfiles"]
}
```

Then run:

```bash
tmux_init
```

This will automatically create tmux sessions based on the configuration in `~/.tmux-session.json`.

You will also have a simple tmux-session switcher available.

## Local Configuration

Some files are gitignored for personal settings:

**`.zshrc.local`** - Personal shell config (sourced by `.zshrc`)

```bash
# Example: Add personal paths, API keys, work-specific aliases
export WORK_DIR="$HOME/work"
```

**`.config/git/config.local`** - Personal git config (included by `.config/git/config`)

```bash
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = your.email@example.com
    signingkey = YOUR_GPG_KEY
```
